GCBR LOGO DOCUMENTATION

Global Core Biodata Resources are strongly encouraged to use the GCBR logo on their website, in presentations and in other promotional material.

Please note that the use of the GCBR logo and title is strictly limited to the entity that applied for and was granted GCBR status, and is listed on the GBC’s website.

For example, if your resource is a member of a wider consortium that was granted GCBR status, you may only use the GCBR logo and description in association with the wider consortium.  The logo does not apply to any specific sub-resource as an independent entity, unless that sub-resource also independently applied and was approved for GCBR status.

When using the logo on websites and other digital materials, you should, wherever possible, hyperlink the logo to the GCBR homepage, https://globalbiodata.org/scientific-activities/global-core-biodata-resources, as shown in the example below.

Please do not stretch or otherwise alter the proportions of the logo.  Please do not recolour the logo or add shading. 

You should make sure the logo is distinct from any background colour, with an appropriate border if necessary.
Logos are provided in Colour (CMYK and RGB) and Mono formats, a range of different file formats are available. 

If you can’t find what you need or have any questions, please emails us at comms@globalbiodata.org
