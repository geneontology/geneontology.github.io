# Download annotations 

GAF files by species can be found at [GAF download page](http://current.geneontology.org/products/pages/downloads.html)

GAF, GPAD and GPI files are also available from the [/annotations/](http://current.geneontology.org/annotations/index.html){:target="blank"} directory of the current release: [http://current.geneontology.org](http://current.geneontology.org){:target="blank"}

## Annotation files: General information

+ Taxon-specific, although some files contain multiple taxons
+ File format guides:
  + [GAF](/docs/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-2.1/): GO Annotation Files are tab-delimited text files that are human-friendly (in addition to machine-readable)
  + [GPAD](/docs/gene-product-association-data-gpad-format/) + [GPI](/docs/gene-product-information-gpi-format/) companion files: Gene Product Association Data (GPAD) files are intended to work in conjunction with a Gene Product Information (GPI) file

## Programmatic access to GO annotations
