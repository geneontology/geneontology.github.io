# Download annotations 

## Current GO annotation downloads
The [GAF download page](http://current.geneontology.org/products/pages/downloads.html) has GAF files for selected species.

GAF & GPAD+GPI files are also available from the [/annotations/](http://current.geneontology.org/annotations/index.html){:target="blank"} directory of the current release: [http://current.geneontology.org](http://current.geneontology.org){:target="blank"}

If your organism is not available in the above links, you can use [AmiGO's annotation search](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/search/annotation)feature to view or download annotations.  [See our FAQ](https://geneontology.org/docs/faq/#where-can-i-view-or-download-the-complete-sets-of-go-annotations) for further information as well as how to retrieve annotations for species that are not available in AmiGO.

## About GO annotation formats

## Programmatic access to GO annotations
As for any resource in GO, GO annotations are accessible through the DOI-versioned release stored in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1205159){:target="blank"} and can be retrieved using BDBag. Read more about [programmatic access](/docs/tools-guide/#programmatic-download-bdbag).
