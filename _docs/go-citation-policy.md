# GO Citation Policy and License

## Citing GO

We ask that whenever using the GO and/or annotations in a publication, please cite the two papers below (the original paper describing GO, and our most recent update paper):
+ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10802651">Ashburner et al. (2000) Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology. Nat Genet 25(1):25-9</a>.
+ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899567">GO Consortium. (2017) Expansion of the Gene Ontology knowledgebase and resource. Nucleic Acids Res. 45(D1):D331-D338]</a>.

If you used a specific software/analysis tool in your research, in addition to the two publications above, please also cite the tool used according to the following list:
+ Enrichment analysis tool: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899595">Mi et al. (2017) Nucleic Acids Res.</a>.
+ AmiGO: <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/2/288.full.pdf+html">Carbon S, Ireland A, Mungall CJ, Shu S, Marshall B, Lewis S, AmiGO Hub, Web Presence Working Group. AmiGO: online access to ontology and annotation data.</a>

## Citing Data from Downloads

If you wish to cite data provided by the Gene Ontology project, either from AmiGO or the files downloaded from the GO website, please state the release date and/or version number of the data, preferably both; e.g. "2018-10-01" or "10.5281/zenodo.1442498". Both annotation and ontology data may change over time, and to reproduce the results of an analysis, it is important that the same initial GO data is used.

### Citing Data from AmiGO

The data release can be found in the page footer on the right-hand side. To cite the annotations of individual database groups please see the GO publications list.

## Citing from the Zotero Archive

Both the Gene Ontology website and AmiGO are compatible with Zotero, the Firefox extension for collecting, managing, citing, and sharing research sources. Please contact the <a href="http://help.geneontology.org">GO Helpdesk</a> if you would like to request support for an alternative reference collection system.

## GO Logo

If you intend to use the logo on your website, please include a link to the GO home page, http://geneontology.org. Please contact the GO Helpdesk if you need a larger or higher resolution version. The logo is subject to our use and license.

The GO logo is available in a number of sizes. Do not hotlink images--download them to reuse.
