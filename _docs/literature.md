# The Gene Ontology and the scientific literature

GO annotations are fundamentally based on the scientific literature. Every individual assertion in the Gene Ontology knowledgebase cites the original information justifying that assertion, and the core of these annotations are those determined through direct experimentation. Currently, the GO includes experimental findings from over [140,000 published papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=loprovGeneOntol[SB]){:target="blank"}, represented as over 600,000 experimentally-supported annotations. These provide the central dataset for additional inference of over 6 million functional annotations for a diverse set of organisms spanning the tree of life.

Reciprocally, the GO resource plays a critical role in furthering biomedical research. GO is referenced in tens of thousands of scientific papers. The major uses of the GO, and links to the associated publications, are listed below:
