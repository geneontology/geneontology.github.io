# Ontology

The Gene Ontology defines the universe of concepts relating to gene functions (‘GO terms’), and how these functions are related to each other (‘relations’). It is constantly revised and expanded as biological knowledge accumulates. The GO describes function with respect to three aspects: **molecular function** (molecular-level activities performed by gene products), **cellular component** (the locations relative to cellular structures in which a gene product performs a function), and **biological process** (the larger processes, or ‘biological programs’ accomplished by multiple molecular activities).

Ongoing revisions to the ontology are managed by a team of senior ontology editors with extensive experience in both biology and computational knowledge representation. Ontology updates are made collaboratively between the GOC ontology team and scientists who request the updates. Most requests come from scientists making GO annotations (these typically impact only a few terms each), and from domain experts in particular areas of biology (these typically revise an entire ‘branch’ of the ontology comprising many terms and relations). We invite researchers and computational scientists to submit requests for either new terms or new relations in the ontology.

The GO ontology is structured as a directed acyclic graph where each term has defined relationships to one or more other terms in the same domain, and sometimes to other domains. The GO vocabulary is designed to be species-agnostic, and includes terms applicable to prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and single and multicellular organisms.

In an example of GO annotation, the gene product "cytochrome c" can be described by the **Molecular Function** term "oxidoreductase activity", the **Biological Process** term "oxidative phosphorylation", and the **Cellular Component** terms "mitochondrial matrix" and "mitochondrial inner membrane".
