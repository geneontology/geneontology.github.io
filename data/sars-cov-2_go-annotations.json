                "description": "The host Golgi apparatus is a series of flattened, cisternal membranes and similar vesicles usually arranged in close apposition to each other to form stacks. In mammalian cells, the host Golgi apparatus is juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar. The stacks are connected laterally by tubules to create a perinuclear ribbon structure, the 'Golgi ribbon'. In plants and lower animal cells, the host Golgi exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the host cytoplasm. It is a polarized structure with, in most higher eukaryotic cells, a cis-face associated with a tubular reticular network of membranes facing the endoplasmic reticulum, the cis-Golgi network (CGN), a medial area of disk-shaped flattened cisternae, and a trans- face associated with another tubular reticular membrane network, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) directed toward the host plasma membrane and compartments of the host endocytic pathway.",
